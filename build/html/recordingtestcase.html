<blockquote>

</div></blockquote>
<p>On the project page, click on the Record button to start recording your automated test case. On the device selection screen, select the device you wish to record on. Remember that the test case that you record will run on any device irrespective of the device that you record on.</p>
<p>After selecting the device on which you wish to record your automation test case you will be taken to the test record page. The page consists of the device screen, a table of automation steps that get generated as actions are recorded and a header with options to enhance the test cases.</p>
<p>There are various options available in the header to enable test creation</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Back button - records an action of a back button being pressed</li>
<li>Enter value - allows user to send input to an input object on the app</li>
<li>Background app - sends the app to the background for 10 seconds</li>
<li>Reset Application - resets the application to make it a fresh installation</li>
<li>Hide Keyboard - hides the keyboard on the screen to allow the user to access other objects</li>
<li>Pause Recording - pauses the recording to enable the user to perform actions on the device or app which s/he does not want to be recorded in the test script.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you hover your mouse pointer over the app that you are testing, you will notice a rectangular placeholder overlaid on top of various objects on the screen. You can also find the name of the object that is currently selected in the header. When a particular object is highlighted using the placeholder, it is selected and you can record various actions related to that object. Upon clicking on an object, you will get recording options related to that object. Some of the popular actions are</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Tap - this records a Tap action on the object that you have selected.</li>
<li>Click - this records a Click action on the object that you have selected.</li>
<li>Verify - this option allows user to create a check (or an assertion as automation engineers would call them) on an object. In the verify dialog, you will notice all the attributes for the object is selected, along with their respective values. If you wish to place a check on a particular object attribute(s), just check the box next to it. When the test case runs, it will check to ensure that the value for that attribute is as expected. In case the value is not as expected, the test step fails.</li>
<li>Disable - Many a times, a few objects on the screen are not selectable because of rectangular placeholders layered over them. To enable access such &#8220;hidden&#8221; objects, you need to click on the Disable button for the overlaying object.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every action that you record on the app is added as a step in the test case table.</p>
<p>If you wish to delete a step you can do that by clicking on the delete button.
You can also edit the name of the test step to make it more intuitive.
One can also reorder the steps, if required, by dragging a step to an appropriate position.</p>
<p>When a user clicks on a text field, the system shows a text box to enter the text value.
When user enters a value in the text box, this is recorded as an input value for the field.</p>
<p>After a test case has been created, click on the Save button to provide a name and save this test case. Click on End session to close the recording session without saving the test case.</p>
<p>Upon saving the test case, you will see your saved test case along with the actual test script and related information. There are four tabs on the test case page.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Test Step: This tab lists the steps of the test case</li>
<li>Test Script: This tab shows the test script to be executed when the automated test case runs. The script is shown in a smart script editor. If the user wishes to add custom code to his/her test scripts, s/he can do that in this script editor. The editor also checks for syntax correctness.</li>
<li>Meta Data: The test script has been designed in a modular way to separate the app objects from the test script. This ensures that the test case can be easily updated and maintained as builds change over time.</li>
<li>User Data: In line with the modular design, the user data too is separated out from the test script and is available in the User Data tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>The test case also offers the Re-record option.</p>
<p>Re-record is a feature used to edit a test case, again, without writing any code.
It is also used to extend an existing test case to create a new test case.</p>
<p>When a user clicks on Re-record, the device selection menu is displayed.
Upon selection of a device, the re-record screen is shown.</p>
<p>The re-record screen resembles the record screen with a few additions.</p>
<p>Play: Clicking on the Play button executes one step at a time. When a user wants to insert a new step, s/he just needs to Play until they reach the step after which they need to record the new step. Then they can record their action as they would do while originally recording a test case. After adding new steps or deleting an existing step, the user can click on Save to update the existing test case. Alternatively, the user can also use Save As to save as a new test case.</p>
