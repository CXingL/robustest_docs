Getting Started
===============

The first step to using RobusTest platform is to create an account for yourself.

If you are using the public instance at http://robustest.com, you can easily create a trial account for yourself from the Sign Up page. Please note that you can sign up on the public platform only with a business email address.

On Sign Up, you will need to confirm your account.

Upon confirmation your account is credited with 60 mins of device usage. Your account is associated with an organization which is generated based on the domain for your email address. Do note that in case of trial accounts, there is an overall cap of 180 minutes on the organization. This cap is not applicable in case of paid accounts.

In case of on-premise enterprise accounts, the process to sign-up may differ e.g. in case of SSO integration, you can just login using your existing credentials. You can get more details from the administrator for your enterprise installation.
