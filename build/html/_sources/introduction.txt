Hi there! Welcome to the RobusTest documentation page.

RobusTest is designed to be a one stop platform for everyone associated with mobile app publishing - business owners to developers and most importantly testers. The RobusTest mobile app testing platform enables testing the app on real devices throughout the application lifecycle. Here are some distinguishing features of the RobusTest platform

Testing on real devices

Performance-first approach to manual and automated testing

Simulate real life scenarios for meaningful testing

Automate your tests and make them data-driven without writing any code

Run your automated tests on multiple devices in parallel

In-depth test reports including both funtional and performance test results

Run your own automated tests on the devices connected to the platform

RobusTest can be accessed both, as a public cloud by signing up at http://robustest.com or, as an on-premise enterprise installation.
In this documentation, we will talk about all the features of RobusTest. However, some of these features may either be specific to the Enterprise version or available only to paid users of RobusTest. For any questions on the documentation, feel free to reach out to us at support@robustest.com

Happy reading!
